# What is this?

This is a WordPress functionality plugin I pieced together specifically for KayMozCeramics based off of [my boilerplate plugin](https://github.com/davemoz/WP-functionality-plugin), which is based off of [Chris Coyier and Jason Witt's CSS Tricks Functionality plugin](https://github.com/chriscoyier/css-tricks-functionality-plugin).

Check out the boilerplate plugin repo above for more info on what it includes.
